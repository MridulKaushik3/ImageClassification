# Image Classification Project

This project is my first end-to-end machine learning project, incorporating simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components alongside the machine learning model. Despite my limited proficiency in these web technologies, I have learned a great deal through this project. 

## About the Project

The main goal of this project is to classify images of five different sports personalities: Virat Kohli, Lionel Messi, Maria Sharapova, Roger Federer, and Serena Williams. The model leverages various techniques and libraries for image processing and machine learning.

### Technologies Used

- OpenCV (`cv2`) for image processing and feature extraction.
- Haarcascade for face detection and visualization.
- Scikit-learn for building and evaluating machine learning models.
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Logistic Regression
  - GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
  - Pipeline for preprocessing and model chaining

### Learning Experience

This project has been more than just a classification task for me. It's been a journey of learning, understanding, and implementing various machine learning algorithms and techniques. Through trial and error, I have gained insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different models and approaches. Moreover, I have developed a better understanding of how to preprocess data effectively and how to fine-tune models for better performance.

### Acknowledgements

I want to express my gratitude to Dhaval Patel and CodeBasics for their invaluable YouTube videos and repositories. Their resources have been instrumental in helping me navigate through this project and understand the underlying concepts better.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed (opencv, scikit-learn, etc.).
3. Run the provided Python script to train the model and save it.
4. Open the HTML page in a web browser.
5. Upload an image containing one of the five sports personalities.
6. See the classification result displayed on the web page.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different models and techniques!

## Note

This project is a work in progress, and I am continuously learning and improving upon it. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to reach out or submit a pull request.
